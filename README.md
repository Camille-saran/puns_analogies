## Abstract
Punalogy is a generator of puns based on analogical templates. Punalogy takes a word as input and generates a pun by substituting a part of the word with a homophone or a similar-sounding word. For example, given the input "mango," Punalogy might generate the pun "man is to mango as woman is to womango." In addition to generating the pun, Punalogy also creates a meme using a template and existing image generation models.
